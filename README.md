# C Logger - A Utility C program for logging events and program flow

<div style="background-color: #ffffff11; font-family: inter; text-align: justify; padding: 12px; border-radius: 5px;">
A Logger header file program written in C as a procedural design to handle events and program flow in your application without worrying about the biggest headache of debugging an issue from multiple program files. CLogger allows you to manage any number of logger instances across your entire project for easy access to different module level loggers.

In a simple words, CLogger is not a shared or compiled library, it is a lightweight, powerful, and flexible logging header program for C programs or applications.
